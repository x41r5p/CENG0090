If considerable changes have been   made to   your   content,   then   this   could   be   considered   academic   misconduct.   Background   research   may   be   performed   using   GenAI   but   it   is expected that any   information obtained from   GenAI   is   critically   evaluated   and validated   using literature sources. Where you have used GenAI for proofreading it is still recommended to do final   proofreading yourself as often technical terms can   be changed   altering the   meaning   completely.   If you   do   use GenAI then you   must acknowledge the   use of   it.Investment    in    renewable      assets      requires      the      large-scale      deployment      of      capital,   amounting   to   potentially   high   risks   for   the   project   sponsors.   To   mitigate   these   risks,   investors       undertake          detailed          due       diligence          to       formulate          a          comprehensive   understanding of a   project,   before making a   Final   Investment   Decision (FID).You   have   identified   a   renewable   asset   that   might   be   a viable   investment   opportunity   for your company, a project sponsor.   You are tasked with   providing a   final   investment   proposal for this renewable asset. Based on the information   provided   below, and your   own   independent   research,   you   need   to   critically   evaluate   the   proposal   and   give   a   robust explanation as to whether your company should consider investing in the renewable asset. <br>Your   proposal   report   should   incorporate   the   following   considerations   to   provide   a   comprehensive project evaluation:<br>An introduction to the project. An investment proposal. The      proposal      will      include      your      chosen      investment   methodology and   propose   key financing   methods and structures to   be   used. This   will   cover   aspects   such   as the   key   parties   involved   in   the   deal, who will finance   the   deal   and how this financing will   occur.Due diligence.

You   should critically assess these   characteristics,   evaluating   their   impact   on   the   viability   of the   proposal   from   an   investor standpoint;   how   might they affect the outcome   and   are   there   any   mitigations   that   could   be   implemented   to   improve   the   attractiveness   of   the   proposal   from   an   investor perspective?<br>A concluding final investment decision. <br>Additional details The asset   details covering the   revenue stream,   country of   development,   and   some   of   the   key   site   details   are   indicated on the   next   page, which   provides you with a   unique   problem   to   discuss.

There    is    a    grid   connection point 3 km away - the local grid is relatively   well stabilised by a battery network   and has been recently upgraded to increase its capacity. The site has flat topography with   no   shading   issues   and   excellent   solar   irradiance   ratings.   Some   seasonal   groundwater   flooding   in 20   % of the site   requires elevated   mounting   systems.   The   local   community   is   supportive   due   to   proposed   sheep   grazing   between   panels,   though   visual   screening   needed   for   nearby   heritage   site   (1   km   away).   An   archaeological   survey   completed   with   no findings.<br>The revenue stream setup   is a fixed   price   PPA over   a   25 year   lifetime.3 - 5: Offshore Wind (500 MW): Seabed   location 25   km from shore with   excellent wind   resource. Port facilities require a £ 50 m upgrade for construction and OM activities. The   grid connection requires a new   40 km subsea cable to shore, then a   further 15 km onshore   to    the    substation.       Marine      mammal      migration      routes      require    seasonal      construction   restrictions.   Commercial   fishing   interests   are   active   in   the   area,   but   a   compensation   framework   has   been   agreed.   There   is   a   moderate   to   severe   risk   of   extreme   weather   events   in   the   area   requiring   the   implementation   of   increased   shoring   (10%   increased   CAPEX   over traditional   shoring   cost)   and the   use   of   high   shear   resistance   blades,   25%   higher CAPEX than traditional   blades.<br>The revenue stream is a hybrid of   a fixed PPA for 15 years, followed by 10 years at market   rate with a price floor guarantee at   70   %   of the original   PPA.6 - 9: Onshore Wind (100 MW): Upland   site   with   exceptional   wind   resource   across   undulating   terrain. A   grid   connection   is   available   8   km   away   but   requires   an   upgrade   to   handle    the    proposed      increased      load.    Access      roads      need      significant      improvement,   including   two   new   bridges.   A   protected   bird   species   nesting   nearby   requires   ongoing   monitoring. The local community has provided a mixed response to the proposal;   farmers   are   supportive,   but   there   is   opposition from   hiking   groups   due   to   a   popular   trail   that will require   re-routing.   Ground   conditions   are   mostly   competent   rock,   with   a   good   bearing   capacity.   The   local   grid   is frequently   imbalanced   due   to   large   quantities   of   rooftop   solar   in the   area. <br>The   revenue   stream   is   a   government   backed   contract   for   difference   over   the   25   year   lifetime, with a floor and ceiling   price   incorporated.<br>The countries under consideration are listed below; your country corresponds to your value of YY:<br>1 - 20:   United Kingdom<br>21- 40: Australia<br>41 - 60:   Norway<br>61 - 80: China<br>81 - 99 (and   00):   Spain<br>If your combination of values gives you Solar   PV in   Norway,   please choose Australia   instead.<br>At the beginning of your coursework, write your student number and the   corresponding   project and country.<br>Marks will be awarded in the following areas: <br>Category <br>Brief Description <br>Weighting <br>Response to task set Arguments develop logically leading to a sound conclusion with a clear understanding of wider context throughout <br>20% <br>Knowledge and Understanding <br>Demonstration of engagement and understanding of course material <br>20% <br>Reasoning and Critical Analysis <br>Demonstration    of ability    to    make    connections between    ideas,    to draw logical insights from them, to consider implications of arguments, and to discuss a variety of sources critically <br>20% <br>Independent thought Own ideas articulated and justified rather than only repetition of content of course materials or readings <br>20% <br>Engagement with literature and <br>referencing <br>A variety of well selected readings are used and <br>references are in the correct format. <br>10% <br>Writing and communication <br>The report reads well and is easy to follow.
